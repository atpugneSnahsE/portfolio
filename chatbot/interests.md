## Research Philosophy & Approach

### Core Beliefs
- **Applied Research First:** Research should solve real problems, not just improve benchmarks
- **Deployment Matters:** Models that work in labs but fail in production have limited value
- **Ethics & Privacy:** AI should be built responsibly with privacy considerations
- **Accessibility Focus:** Technology should empower everyone, regardless of abilities
- **Sustainability:** AI systems should consider energy efficiency and environmental impact
- **Open Knowledge:** Research benefits from open collaboration and knowledge sharing

### What Excites Me
"I'm motivated by building AI systems that actually work outside controlled environments. Seeing a model perform reliably in the real world—under noise, constraints, and imperfect data—is far more satisfying than achieving marginal benchmark improvements."
