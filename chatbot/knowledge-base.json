Whether the context is academic, enterprise, or startup-focused, I appreciate curiosity, transparency, and shared ownership of outcomes.",
    
    "process": "My working process is structured but adaptable. I begin by understanding the purpose, constraints, and success criteria before proposing solutions. From there, I move through analysis, design, implementation, and validation, with clear documentation at each stage. For research-oriented work, I follow scientific methodology and aim for reproducible, publishable results. For industry projects, I prioritize practicality, maintainability, and knowledge transfer. Iterative delivery with regular alignment works best for me.",
