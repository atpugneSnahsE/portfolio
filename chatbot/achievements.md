## Personal Reflection on Achievements

"What I'm most proud of isn't just the numbers - the 11 papers, 200+ students trained, or 500+ community members. It's that each achievement represents solving real problems and helping real people. Whether it's making campuses safer, helping visually impaired individuals navigate, or watching a student deploy their first ML model - that's what drives me. The recognition is nice, but the impact is what matters."
